1. **API Key Permissions**: Only enable "Read" permissions on your Binance API key
2. **Environment Variables**: Never commit your `.env` file or expose your API credentials
3. **Secure Storage**: Store your API keys securely in the `.env` file only
4. **Configuration Files**: Never add API keys directly to MCP configuration files
5. **Rate Limits**: Be aware of Binance API rate limits to avoid being temporarily banned

## Troubleshooting

### Server not starting
- Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed: `node --version`
- Check that the build completed successfully: `npm run build`
- Verify your API credentials are correctly set in `.env`

### Authentication errors
- Double-check your API key and secret are correct
- Ensure your API key has read permissions enabled
- Check if your API key is restricted by IP (add your IP if needed)

### No data returned
- Verify you have holdings in your Binance account
- Check if the Binance API is accessible from your location
- Ensure your account has API access enabled

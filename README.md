## Security Considerations

1. **API Key Permissions**: Only enable "Read" permissions on your Binance API key
2. **Configuration Security**: Your API keys are stored in MCP configuration files - keep these files secure
3. **Read-Only Access**: This tool only reads your portfolio data, never executes trades
4. **Rate Limits**: Be aware of Binance API rate limits to avoid being temporarily banned
5. **Local Storage**: MCP configuration files are stored locally on your machine only

## Troubleshooting

### Server not starting
- Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed: `node --version`
- Verify your API credentials are correctly set in MCP configuration
- Check that npx can download the package: `npx binance-mate-mcp --help`

### Authentication errors
- Double-check your API key and secret are correct in the MCP config
- Ensure your API key has read permissions enabled
- Check if your API key is restricted by IP (add your IP if needed)

### No data returned
- Verify you have holdings in your Binance account
- Check if the Binance API is accessible from your location
- Ensure your account has API access enabled
